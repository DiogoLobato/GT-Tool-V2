# Master Thesis Project: "Vulnerability Detection in Multiple Languages"

- In this version, **GT-Tool** supports value tracking (primitive values and objects), web frameworks, multiple file analysis in one execution and many other functionalities that are explained in detail in the dissertation document.

- To run an application/program, check the *ParserRun.java* file (main entry point to give the tool the necessary information to analyse the application) which contains an example there. Can also go through the *experimentalEvaluationTests* folder to see how the tests were made!

 Will update this README if needed.
